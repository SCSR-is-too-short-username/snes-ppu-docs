# Overview

This repository contains will contain documentation on the SNES PPUs, 5c77 (S-PPU1) and 5c78 (S-PPU2). Right now there isn't much here, but I'll add stuff here over time.

# Tracing

The die shots for both PPU is available at siliconpr0n, which I have been using for tracing to figure out how they work. Currently the tracing progress is:

5c77: ~35% done

5c78: Completed
