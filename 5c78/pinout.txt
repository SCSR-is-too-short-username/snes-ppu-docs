========================
--- Pin Descriptions ---
========================

--- VCC ---

Voltage input pin

--- AVCC ---

Analog voltage input pin
Provide +5V to DAC

--- GND ---

Ground pin

--- /BURST ---

Color burst flag
Active low
Tells the S-ENC when to add color burst
Since phase offset is used to determine hue (at least in NTSC video), the TV needs some reference to syncronize to and compare the phase of the actual video signal do display the correct hue
Connected to /BFP and /PCP in S-ENC

--- /PED ---

Unknown
Probably pedestal clamp pulse
Active low
As far as I know, this is used to latch a reference voltage for black level
Normally disconnected, but probably was intended to connect to /PCP in S-ENC

--- 3.58M ---

S-ENC VCXO input
NTSC video uses 3.58MHz as the chrominance subcarrier frequency
The S-ENC probably uses this to generate the color burst reference and chrominance signal for the TV

--- /TRANSPARENT ---

Transparent pixel output
Active low
Low when a pixel output color is all zeros
Input pin in debug mode 8
Normally disconnected

--- /PAWR ---

Write signal
Active low
Signals that the CPU wants to write to the address on PA0..7

--- /PARD ---

Read signal
Active low
Signals that the CPU wants to read from the address on PA0..7

--- CPU D0..7 ---

CPU data bus pins

--- PA0..7 ---

B-bus address bus pins

--- HBLANK ---

Horizontal blanking signal
Connected to pin of same name in S-CPU

--- VBLANK ---

Vertical blanking signal
Connected to pin of same name in S-CPU

--- /5MOUT ---

Pixel clock out
Active low
Connected to DOTCLK in expansion port

--- /RESOUT1 ---

Reset output signal
Active low
Connected to /RESET pin in S-CPU

--- EXTLATCH ---

External counter latch
Latches the horizontal and vertical position counter values
Connected to JPIO7 in the controller port board

--- PALMODE ---

NTSC/PAL mode select
Changes timing of most vertical timing signals to occur 24 scanlines later
Connected to ground in NTSC and NTSC-J consoles and connected to VCC in PAL consoles

--- XIN ---

Master clock in

--- /RESOUT0 ---

Reset output signal
Active low
Connected to /RESET pin in S-PPU1

--- /RESET ---

Reset input signal
Connected to the P10 pin in CIC

--- FIELD ---

Interlace field
Changes state every frame and indicates whether to draw on odd or even numbered scanlines when interlace is enabled
Connected to pin of same name in S-PPU1

--- /OVER1 ---

Unknown
Active low
When low, BG1 is forcibly disabled when TST15 is low
When TST15 is high, used to select debug mode
Connected to /OVER in S-PPU1

--- /5MIN ---

Pixel clock in
Active low
Latches data from VDA0..7, VDB0..7 and EXT0..7 pins
Connected to /5MOUT in S-PPU1

--- /HCLD ---

Horizontal counter clear
Active low
Resets the OPHCT counter and unfreezes the OPVCT counter
Connected to pin of same name in S-PPU1

--- /VCLD ---

Vertical counter clear
Active low
When this pin and /HCLD are low, clears the OPVCT counter
Connected to pin of same name in S-PPU1

--- COLOR0..2 ---

Sprite pixel palette
Connected to pins of same name in S-PPU1

--- PRIO0..1 ---

Sprite pixel priority
Connected to pins of same name in S-PPU1

--- CHR0..3 ---

Sprite pixel color index
Connected to pins of same name in S-PPU1

--- /OVER2 ---

Unknown
Active low
When low, BG2 is forcibly disabled when TST15 is low
When TST15 is high, used to select debug mode
Connected to /OVER in S-PPU1

--- VDB0..7 ---

VRAM bus high bits

--- VDA0..7 ---

VRAM bus low bits

--- EXT0..7 ---

Extra background data pins
These pins were unused and connected to VDB0..7

--- TST0..15 ---

Primary debug mode pins
0..11 are output
12..14 are I/O
15 is input
0..11 are disconnected
12..15 are grounded
12..14 used to select debug mode when 15 is low
When 15 is high, /over1..2 are used to select debug mode and 12..14 are output

--- AR, AG, AB ---

Analog RGB output
Connected to pins of same name in S-ENC

--- HVCMODE ---

Home video computer mode
Normally grounded
Setting this pin high has the same effect as pulling /RESET pin low
Most likely the original intent was to use this for the planned NES backwards compability mode

--- /CSYNC ---

Composite sync
Active low
Connected to SYNC pin in S-ENC
